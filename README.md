## New features

#### Modulr Package - Generate modules in the project

This package is added as a helper toolkit to generate the module in the project with just a command
line.

## Modulr

Modulr is a code generator tool specially created for `FlutterFusion` starter kit, This helps you to generate all the files required for a Module.

### Usage of Modulr

Below is the example of how you can use this package and provided commands

1. `modulr:generate`: This is generates whole code for a module.
2. `modulr:controller`: This command generates a Controller file inside the provided module.
3. `modulr:page`: This command generates a Page/View file inside the provided module.

### Generate Module

```shell
dart pub run modulr:generate Blog
```

This will generate all the files required for a `Module`

#### Generated Files Inside your project's `lib/app/modules` directory.

```txt
ðŸ“‚ blog
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ controllers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_controller.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_router.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_routes.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ api_blog_service.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_service.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ local_blog_service.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ views
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_page.dart
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_module.dart
```

### Generate Page/View

dart pub run modulr:page Comment --on=blog
```

This will generate the new view/page (`comment_page.dart`) along with it's controller (`comment_controller.dart`) file inside the `Blog` Module.

#### Generated files (including previously generated views)

```txt
ðŸ“‚ blog
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ controllers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_controller.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ comment_controller.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ views
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_page.dart
